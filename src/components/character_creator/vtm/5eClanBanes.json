  "clans": {
    "Banu Haqim": "When one of the Judges tastes the Blood of another Cainite, they find it very hard to stop. Slaking at least one Hunger level with vampiric vitae provokes a Hunger Frenzy test at a Difficulty 2 + Bane Severity.[4] If the test is failed they attempt to gorge themselves on vampire Blood, sometimes until they diablerize their Kindred victim. ",
    "Brujah": "Violent Temper: Subtract dice equal to the Bane Severity of the Brujah from any roll to resist fury frenzy. This cannot take the pool below one die. (V5 Corebook p.67)",
    "Caitiff": "Caitiff characters begin with the Suspect (•) Flaw and you may not purchase positive Status for them during character creation. The Storyteller may always impose a one or two dice penalty on Social tests against fellow Kindred who know they are Caitiff, regardless of their eventual Status. Further, to improve one of the Disciplines of a Caitiff costs six times the level purchased in experience points ",
    "Gangrel": "In frenzy, Gangrel gain one or more animal features: a physical trait, a smell, or a behavioral tic. These features last for one more night afterward, lingering like a hangover following debauchery. ",
    "Hecata": "The Hecata's kiss is torture to their prey. The pain is unbearable and all encompassing. ",
    "Lasombra": "Distorted Image: The broken souls of Lasombra vampires are halfway drawn into the Abyss. All reflections and recordings distort, flicker, or become transparent (though this does not conceal their identity with any certainty). Microphones have the same difficulty with the vampire's voice as cameras have with their image, touch technology becomes unresponsive at best, and their anomalous nature makes it harder to avoid electronic detection systems. ",
    "Malkavian": "Derangement: When the Malkavian suffers a Bestial Failure or a Compulsion, their curse comes to the fore. Suffer a penalty equal to your character's Bane Severity to one category of dice pools (Physical, Social, or Mental) for the entire scene. This is in addition to any penalties incurred by Compulsions. ",
    "Nosferatu": "Repulsiveness: Hideous and vile, all Nosferatu count as having the Repulsive Flaw (-2) and can never increase their rating in the Looks Merit. In addition, any attempt to disguise themselves as non-deformed incurs a penalty to the dice pool equal to the character's Bane Severity (this includes the Obfuscate powers Mask of a Thousand Faces and Manifold Guise). However, most do not break the Masquerade by just being seen.  ",
    "Ravnos": "Doomed: A Ravnos' Bane is that the sun's fire that incinerated their founder rages through the Blood of the clan, erupting from their very flesh if they ever settle down for long. If they slumber in the same place more than once in seven nights, roll a number of dice equal to their Bane Severity. They receive aggravated damage equal to the number of 10’s (critical results) rolled as they are scorched from within. This happens every time they spend the day in a location they've already slumbered less than a week before. What constitutes a location in this regard depends on the scope of the chronicle, but unless otherwise stated, two resting places need to be at least a mile apart to avoid triggering the Bane. Furthermore, a mobile haven, such as a movers’ truck, is safe so long as the place where the truck is parked is at least a mile from the last location. ",
    "Salubri": "Hunted: A Salubri's Bane is that the Kindred of other clans are especially appreciative of Salubri vitae. When a non-Salubri partakes of the blood of a Cyclops, they often find it difficult to pull themselves away. Consuming enough to abate at least one Hunger level requires a Hunger Frenzy test. If the test fails, they just keep consuming, to the point that they may have to be physically fought off. Additionally, the third eye that Saulot opened while on one of his many journeys passes down through the bloodline every time a Salubri Embraces. This third eye is not always recognizably human in origin, and rumors persist of vertical, serpentine pupils, or even wormlike eyespots. While this third eye can be physically covered, such as with a headscarf or hood, it is always present, and no supernatural power can obscure it. Any time a Salubri activates a Discipline power, the third eye weeps vitae, its intensity correlating to the level of the Discipline being used, from welling up to a torrential flow. The blood flow from the third eye triggers a Hunger Frenzy test from nearby vampires with Hunger 4 or more.  ",
    "Toreador": "Aesthetic Fixation: The Toreador exemplify the old saying that art in the blood takes strange forms. They desire beauty so intensely that they suffer in its absence. While your character finds themselves in less than beautiful surroundings, lose the equivalent of their Bane Severity in dice from dice pools to use Disciplines. ",
    "Tremere": "Tremere vitae can no longer Blood Bond other Kindred, though they themselves can be Bound by Kindred from other clans. A Tremere can still bind mortals and ghouls, though the corrupted vitae must be drunk an additional number of times equal to the vampire's Bane Severity for the bond to form. ",
    "Tzimisce": "Grounded: Each Tzimisce must choose a specific charge — a physical domain, a group of people, an organization, or even something more esoteric — but clearly defined and limited. The Kindred must spend their daysleep surrounded by their chosen charge.  ",
    "Ventrue": "Rarefied Tastes: When a Ventrue drinks blood from any mortal outside their preference, a profound exertion of will is required or the blood taken surges back up as scarlet vomit. Ventrue can sense if a mortal possesses the blood they require. If Ventrue want to feed from anything but their preferred victim, they must spend Willpower points equal to the character's Bane Severity. ",
    "The Ministry": "Abhors the Light - when exposed to direct illumination - whether natural or artificial - members of the clan recoil.",
    "Thin-Blood": "Thin-bloods do not possess a clan bane, their vitae is too far removed. "
