  "Animalism": {
    "name": "Untamed",
    "description": "Such a tight relationship with the Beast comes at a cost, as it refuses to be leashed. Failing to Ride the Wave during Frenzy inflicts two Stains. Convictions cannot mitigate these Stains."
  },
  "Auspex": {
    "name": "Daymares",
    "description": "While rarely recalling more than an acute sense of terror, the vampire's daylight rest becomes plagued by horrifying visions, causing them to sweat blood. When awakening for the night, make two Rouse Checks instead of the usual one."
  },
  "Blood Sorcery": {
    "name": "Sanguinary Animism",
    "description": "The sorcerer has become so attuned to reading the vagaries of blood that during feeding, the flood of information and voices from the victim cannot be avoided, even persisting beyond the hunt. For any scene following a feeding, the vampire loses two dice from all Social and Mental pools due to the distraction."
  },
  "Celerity": {
    "name": "Breakdown",
    "description": "The vampire's physiology runs at the same pace as the vampire, burning blood and energy at equal volumes. Whenever the vampire fails a Rouse Check when activating a Celerity power, they sustain a point of Aggravated Health damage, and their body withers and ages before their very eyes."
  },
  "Dominate": {
    "name": "Blunt",
    "description": "The strain of enforcing their will upon others erodes something critical in the mind of the dominator, making mundane social interactions fraught. Vampires with this Flaw cannot spend Willpower to reroll a Social test."
  },
  "Fortitude": {
    "name": "Scar Tissue",
    "description": "This Flaw impairs the vampire's ability to maintain the appearance of health following an injury. While rousing the Blood restores Health as normal, the physical appearance of any injuries sustained remains until they rest for the day. This can easily result in Masquerade breaches if not carefully managed."
  },
  "Obfuscate": {
    "name": "Faded",
    "description": "The vampire spends so much time hiding from others that they have begun to forget who they truly are. This lack of conviction weakens their moral fortitude and makes them second-guess decisions. When making Remorse tests, the vampire rolls one fewer die (the one-die minimum still applies)."
